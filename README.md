Q1) Identify FRs and NFRs:

Functional Requirements:

1)Allow the librarian to add and remove new members.

2)Should be a login page for users.

3)The user can log in, view the catalog, search for books, checkout, reserve, renew and return a book.

4)Allow the user to search for books based on title, publication date, author, etc., and find their location in the library.

5)Users can request, reserve, or renew a book.

6)Librarian can add and manage the books.

7)The system should notify the user and librarian about the overdue books.

8)The system calculates the fine for overdue books on their return.

9)The system should store all the information about librarians and users,their access keys,priority,etc.

10)The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing,if no other booking for that particular book has been made.

11)The system should allow the librarians to add,delete and modify items in the database and check availability of the items.


Non-Functional Requirements:


1)Usability:

Usability is the main non-functional requirement for a library information system. The UI should be simple enough for everyone to understand and get the relevant information without any special training. 

2)Accuracy:

The data stored about the books and the fines calculated should be correct, consistent, and reliable.

3)Availability:

The System should be available for the duration when the library operates and must be recovered within an hour or less if it fails. 

4)Maintainability:

The software should be easily maintainable and adding new features and making changes to the software must be as simple as possible.

5)Safety Requirements:

The database may get crashed at any certain time due to virus or operating system failure. Therefore it is required to take the database backup.

6)Performance:

The Server would be able to perform desired tasks in a reasonable unit of time.

7)Security:

The system would provide access to only legitimate users. It will be secure on the network and only authorized people can use it.


Q2)Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies, where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.


Scope:

We are creating an android application for people who suffer from disabling hearing loss using an artificial intelligence software which recognises basic key sounds such as car horns and gives immediate alerts to the users.


Features:

1)This mobile application should alert the users when it recognizes the sounds of critical situations.

2)The predictions of the Mobile application should be very accurate.

3)The app should consume less power and should have little latency.

4)The app should take some response from the user when a critical situation is detected to ensure that the user has been alerted.


Non-Functional Aspects:

1)The app should alert the users through some vibrations.

2)This app is optimized for android with low-latency so that it works in real time for use.

3)The app should be portable, so that moving from one OS to another OS does not create any problem.

4)The app should be able to track the live location of users that can be sent to friends and family in emergency situations.

5)The app should be able to suggest the routes to be taken while traveling where there is less traffic.
